The goal of this example is to construct a movie recommendation algorithm based on the evaluation data
of existing users and output movies that may be of interest to specific users.
The main steps are:
Step 1.Load the dataset and parse it into a specific format according to the rules.
Step 2.The parsed data are divided into two parts, which are the training set and the test set of the 
model.
Step 3.Use alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to train the matrix model between users and movies.
Step 4.The training set is used to predict and the test set is used to verify the validity of the 
prediction results.
User-based CF: User-based collaborative filtering is used to evaluate the similarity between users 
by the scores of different users on item, and make recommendations based on the similarity between users.

On GroupLens'website, you can find a dataset called MoiveLens. And here is the content of labels:
http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m-README.txt

First, we download and extract the required dataset files
su -l hadoop
wget http://labfile.oss.aliyuncs.com/courses/600/ml-1m.zip
unzip ml-1m.zip
we put files in the "/ home / Hadoop" directory
